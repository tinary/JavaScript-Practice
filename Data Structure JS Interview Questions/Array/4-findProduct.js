/*
Implement a function, findProduct(arr), 
which modifies an array so that each index has a product of all the numbers present in the array 
except the number stored at that index.

Input
An array of numbers (can even be floats, integers, and negative!)

Output
An array such that each index has a product of all the numbers in the array 
except the number stored at that index.

Sample Input
arr = [1,2,3,4]

Sample Output
arr = [24,12,8,6]
